<h1>Best films of all time according to Adam</h1>

<h2>My top 3 films.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>Has insanely cool, 90's vibes. The soundtrack is unreal (shoutout to Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Tears over Fears). The story is mysterious, confusing and begs for a deep dive/second watch.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Goes without saying.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>You don't not talk about fight club.</p>
